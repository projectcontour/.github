# Welcome to Contour!
![Contour is fun at parties!](../../../contour/blob/main/contour.png)

Contour is an Ingress controller for Kubernetes that works by deploying the [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
Contour supports dynamic configuration updates out of the box while maintaining a lightweight profile.

Contour also introduces a new ingress API ([HTTPProxy](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/fundamentals/)) which is implemented via a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
Its goal is to expand upon the functionality of the Ingress API to allow for a richer user experience as well as solve shortcomings in the original design.
